      "You laughed today, and for a second, it felt like the world paused just to let you feel that happiness. I love seeing you like that, cintaku.",
      "Your presence has this calm energy, even chaos turns gentle when you’re around. You’re my peace, semestaku hihi.",
      "You probably caught yourself daydreaming again, and those simple thoughts hold more warmth than a thousand perfect days. I love you endlessly, sayang.",
      "The little things — your laugh, a glance, the way you say my name — fill every moment with quiet magic. You’re my favorite part of every day, cintaku yang gemas nan lucu.",

      "I can see the exhaustion behind your eyes, that quiet weight you carry without ever saying a word. I wish I could hold you now, sayang, and let you rest.",
      "Every step takes double the energy, yet you still keep going. That’s strength, even when it doesn’t feel like it. I’m proud of you, semestaku. I love you.",
      "There’s a heaviness in you today that no smile or coffee can fix, and that’s okay. It’s just one of those days. Let me be your calm, my love.",
      "You’ve been stretched thin between what you need and what you have to do, I hope you find a moment to breathe. I’m right here, sayang, holding you in my heart.",
      "By tonight, I know you’re not just physically tired, but emotionally drained too. I wish I could help you rest from the inside out. I love you, always."

    sad: [
      "I know there’s an emptiness in you today, a hollow space where happiness used to be, and no one else seems to notice. But I do, sayang. I love you more than words.",
      "Even when you laugh, I can tell it’s a little borrowed, like you’re trying to hide that quiet weight in your chest. I see you, cintaku, and I’ll never stop loving you.",
      "There are moments you just want to disappear, not because you want to give up, but because everything feels so heavy. I’ll stay with you through it all, my love.",
      "You sit in silence, and I know those memories still echo softly in places no one else can see. I’m here, sayang, holding you with my heart.",
      "Sometimes tears just fall, uninvited, and that’s okay. Holding them back would only hurt more. Let them fall, I’ll be here to wipe them away. Love you sayaangg.",
      "I notice the small cracks, the parts of you that ache even when you’re surrounded by people. I love all of you, sayang, even the quiet pain you hide.",
      "By night, when you lie awake, I know that sadness wraps around you like a blanket you never asked for. But I’ll be your warmth, my love, until you feel light again."
